### Task 1
Task 1 can be found in its corresponding folder, which contains the notebook along with all related files, including the accompanying report.

#### Excercise 
The Enron email (Klimt & Yang, 2004) network is a social network constructed from email communication in a large corporation.

Due to its size it has previously been
partitioned only by algorithms such as Fast Greedy community detection.

The Enron corpus, a large set of email messages, was made public during the legal investigation concerning the Enron corporation.

The raw Enron corpus contains 619,446 messages sent to and received by 158 Enron employees.

From this email corpus a network was constructed in which the email addresses are represented by nodes and emails between two addresses are represented by links. This network contains 77849 nodes and 310744
directed weighted links.

Non-Enron email addresses act as sinks and sources because only emails from and to Enron employees were included in the corpus. The network does not contain an explicit community structure, but community structure has been explored using community detection algorithms.

#### Goal
Identify different positions in a hierarchy
